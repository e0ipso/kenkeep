## [1.0.0](https://github.com/e0ipso/ai-knowledge-base/compare/v0.2.0...v1.0.0) (2026-05-12)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `_proposed/` directory and the `proposal:`
frontmatter block are removed. Skills, the curator, manual
`node add`, and bootstrap all write directly to
`nodes/<kind>/<id>.md`. Acceptance is `git commit`; rejection is
`git restore <path>`.

The lint-staged pre-commit hook runs `ai-knowledge-base index
rebuild --stage` on any staged `nodes/**/*.md`, regenerating
INDEX.md and GRAPH.md and staging them into the same commit, so
the index never drifts from the committed nodes. `init` writes
`.lintstagedrc.cjs` (with `--concurrent false` in
`.husky/pre-commit` for serial execution) instead of patching
`package.json` with a `lint-staged` block.

Curator action handling: `add` writes a new node (fail-loud as
`add_collision` if the file already exists); `modify` overwrites
the target (fail-loud as `modify_missing_target` if the target
is absent); `contradict` records the conflict in
`.ai/knowledge-base/.state/pending-conflicts.json` instead of
writing. The kb-curate skill resolves conflicts in-session with
the user.

Schema changes: `BootstrapDocEntrySchema.produced_proposals` is
renamed to `produced_nodes`; `CurateResult.proposalsWritten` is
renamed to `nodesWritten` and gains `failures: FailureReport[]`
and `conflicts: ConflictReport[]` arrays. `ProposalKindSchema`,
`ProposalBlockSchema`, and `ProposalFrontmatterSchema` are
removed.

### Features

* drop _proposed/, write nodes/ directly ([2692fe6](https://github.com/e0ipso/ai-knowledge-base/commit/2692fe69b37f75468b947713d19c8b1ae7ba4590))

## Unreleased

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The `_proposed/` directory and the `proposal:` frontmatter block have been removed. Skills, the curator, manual `node add`, and bootstrap all write directly to `nodes/<kind>/<id>.md`. Acceptance is `git commit`; rejection is `git restore <path>`. Existing repositories with a populated `_proposed/` directory must hand-promote any in-flight proposals into `nodes/` (strip the `proposal:` block, move the file) and then delete the `_proposed/` directory before upgrading.
* `BootstrapDocEntrySchema.produced_proposals` renamed to `produced_nodes`. Entries are bare `<kind>/<filename>.md` paths relative to `nodes/`.
* `CurateResult.proposalsWritten` renamed to `nodesWritten`. New fields `failures: FailureReport[]` and `conflicts: ConflictReport[]` carry per-action outcomes.
* `init` writes `.lintstagedrc.cjs` and no longer adds a `lint-staged` block to `package.json`.

### Features

* `ai-knowledge-base index rebuild --stage` regenerates `INDEX.md`/`GRAPH.md` and runs `git add` on the result. Wired into the lint-staged pre-commit step on `nodes/**/*.md` so the index lands in the same commit as any node change. No-ops outside a git repo.
* Curator surfaces contradictions via `.ai/knowledge-base/.state/pending-conflicts.json`. The `/kb-curate` skill walks each entry with the user in-session and applies the chosen resolution.
* `add` actions targeting an existing node and `modify` actions whose target is missing are reported as structured failures (`add_collision`, `modify_missing_target`) rather than silently overwriting or dropping.
* `ai-knowledge-base status` reports curator-conflict count and a per-kind node tally.
